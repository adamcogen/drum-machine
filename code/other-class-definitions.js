     * on beats 4 and 5 will just be deleted.

     * whatever time the existing notes are at, we will snap them to the closest new subdivision. that way seems
     * like it will make sense. also, maybe we can de-dup things, so any notes with the same sample that fall on 
     * the same beat after doing this will be de-duped and only one will remain for each sample? need to think
